CS652 -- Programming Languages
=====

This is the home page for Computer Science 652, Graduate Programming Languages, at the University of San Francisco.

# Abstract

Because programming languages are at the core of how we communicate with machines, programmers should have a thorough understanding of how languages are designed, implemented, and manipulated. This course concerns itself specifically with the implementation and translation of computer languages, leaving an in-depth study of language design to another course. Students will learn the formalisms behind computer languages, but the focus will be on developing the ability to build languages and their translators.

This class can be challenging conceptually. Some of the language formalisms take a while to sink in. Well, actually you have one major hurdle to get over and then it's easy--abstraction in the sense of recursion, meta-language, programs that generate other programs (or even themselves), etc... If you get a headache when you try to figure out how the first C compiler could have been written in C, you might invest in a big bottle of aspirin.

Students are required to build projects in Java unless specified otherwise. You should have a good understanding of data structures, algorithms, and recursion. Prior experience with language implementation is helpful, but not required. You will be expected to write a lot of code this semester, culminating in a complete programming language implementation.

Two graduate classes is considered full-time at USF and, hence, you can expect this class to require about 20 hours/week of class time and homework/development time. You should start early on every project. Note that there is no such thing as a late project. Late projects get a 0 grade as I will be handing out the solutions the day projects are due.
